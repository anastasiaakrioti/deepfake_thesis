# DeepFake Video Detection Using Deep Learning

This thesis explores the growing threat of deepfake videos, which are increasingly used to spread fake news, misinformation, and manipulate public opinion. With the rapid advancement of media synthesis technologies, detecting such manipulated content has become a critical and complex challenge.

This project proposes a deepfake detection method based on deep learning techniques, aiming to improve the accuracy of classifying images as real or fake. The implementation leverages the pre-trained EfficientNet convolutional neural network, which is applied to static frames extracted from videos via sampling. 

The analysis is conducted on three distinct datasets — each with unique characteristics — to ensure the model’s robustness and generalizability. The classifier is developed in Python using modern deep learning libraries such as PyTorch. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.
